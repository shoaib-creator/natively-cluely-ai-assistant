// F-413 regression test (audit/autopilot-2026-08-18).
//
// CONFIDENCE_BOOST.high (0.15) exceeded the default minScore floor (0.12), so a
// high-confidence card cleared the floor with ZERO title/body/entity/tag
// overlap — measured pre-fix at exactly 0.150. OkfCardBuilder marks every
// metadata card and every sectioned card with >=30 body words 'high', so
// essentially every real pack contains them: queryOkfCards returned a
// non-empty set for any question with a content word, and EvidenceAssembler's
// tier 4 ("no cards AND no chunks") became unreachable at the repair-gate call
// site, which passes rawChunkText:''.
//
// SCOPE: this covers the SCORED path only. A whole-document synthesis question
// (isSynthesis with no target entities) deliberately short-circuits to the
// first N content cards with score 1 so "what is the conclusion?" returns the
// document's conclusion rather than depending on word overlap. That is by
// design and is left alone; the harm it could cause at the repair gate was
// removed separately by F-412, which stopped the tier signal overriding the
// off-topic refusal gate.
