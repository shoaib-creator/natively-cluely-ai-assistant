// Campaign 2 longsession run-039 script-a/c investigation (2026-07-19):
// live-path integration test for the unrecovered-scaffold-contamination
// fallback, wired into IntelligenceEngine.ts right after the existing
// detectAndExtractScaffoldMisfire block. Confirms the bounded regeneration
// actually reaches the user on the live WTA path, not just the pure
// hasUnrecoveredScaffoldContamination function (see
// electron/llm/__tests__/UnrecoveredScaffoldContamination_2026_07_19.test.mjs
// for those unit tests).
//
// Live repros A4/A5/C9 (see campaign2-log.md iteration 47) all carry the
// same coding-scaffold fingerprint detectAndExtractScaffoldMisfire already
// recovers in other shapes, but with real content sitting under a
// model-invented heading (e.g. "## STAR Story, Streaming Reconciliation at
// Stripe") none of that function's fixed extraction patterns match — so
// extraction returns null and the raw scaffold-and-meta-commentary text
// would otherwise ship untouched. This guard's fallback mirrors the
// answer-relevance guard's exact repair mechanics (bounded regeneration,
// re-check before accepting, fall through unchanged on repair failure).

- I want to land on a clear, structured answer that pulls directly from your Stripe work on the streaming reconciliation system, since that is the most defensible "recent impact" story.
- The framing should be tight: pick one project, own it end-to-end, then add one or two sharp metrics that prove scale.

## STAR Story, Streaming Reconciliation at Stripe
- **Situation:** I was the tech lead on Stripe's payment reconciliation. The legacy pipeline was a nightly Hadoop batch job that took 14 hours to close the books.
- **Task:** Replace it with a streaming pipeline that could keep the ledger in sync with the payments surface in near real time.
- **Action:**
  - Designed a Kafka-based ingestion layer with exactly-once semantics into Flink.

## Technique / Data Structure / Algorithm Used
- Kafka exactly-once ingestion, Flink stream processing, DynamoDB conditional writes for idempotency.`;
