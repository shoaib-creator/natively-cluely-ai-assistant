// PR #427 §3.3: "Dynamic require() in the hot answer path".
//
// IntelligenceEngine reached Context OS through 10 synchronous
// `require('./intelligence/context-os')` calls inside runWhatShouldISay and the
// follow-up/recap paths. They bypass the TypeScript module graph, defeat
// tree-shaking, and each one re-does a module lookup on every answer.
//
// Verified before changing anything:
//   - context-os does NOT import IntelligenceEngine (no dependency cycle), so
//     the dynamic form was never required to break a cycle;
//   - the `catch { return true; }` fail-open at the profile-repair gate is
//     defence-in-depth, not a live leak: candidateProfile is already cleared
//     upstream when the contract denies profile, so `profileLoaded` is false
//     and the gate cannot re-open a denied source. The conversion therefore
//     preserves behaviour exactly and is purely mechanical.
//
// This suite pins the outcome so the dynamic form cannot creep back, and
// re-asserts the security property that made the conversion safe.
