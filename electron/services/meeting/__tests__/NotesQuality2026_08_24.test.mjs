// ── Fix 2 (2026-08-25): only the chunk-extraction call had its timeout raised past the

// 7,996ms against the OLD 8,000ms cap — 4ms to spare — which is why that call site was
// raised to 60s/'extraction'. SummaryPolisher.polish()/polishOverview() must now pass the
// shared NOTE_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS too, so a longer meeting doesn't blow the 8s default on a
// writing call and silently fall through to a cheaper provider. Timeout only — never
