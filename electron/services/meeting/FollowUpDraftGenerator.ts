// FollowUpDraftGenerator.ts (Phase 8)
// Produces a short, human, copy-paste-ready follow-up draft from the FINAL note content
// only (overview + decisions + action items + open questions). It NEVER reads raw
// transcript and NEVER invents promises beyond what the note already contains.
//
// LLM-based via generateStructured (one small JSON call), with a deterministic fallback
// that is used when the LLM is unavailable, scope-denied, or returns nothing usable.
//
// Mode → draft type mapping:
//   sales              → email (deal-style) / crm_note recipe handled separately
//   recruiting         → email
//   team-meet          → project_update
//   technical-interview→ interview_feedback
//   lecture            → study_notes
//   looking-for-work   → email
//   general/other      → email

FIRST, understand the meeting from the notes below: what was it about, what actually happened, and what genuinely needs a follow-up. Not every note deserves to be in the message — pick the few things that matter and would be embarrassing to drop.

WHAT "FOLLOWING UP" MEANS HERE:
${followUpMeaning}

AUDIENCE & VOICE:
- Addressed to: ${profile.recipient}
- Salutation: ${profile.salutation}
- Sign-off: ${profile.closing}
- Register: ${profile.register}
- Cover, in order: ${structure}

STRICT RULES:
- Ground everything in the notes below. Do NOT invent decisions, owners, deadlines, numbers, pricing, or promises that aren't there.
- Be specific to THIS meeting — reference the actual topics, names, and outcomes from the notes, not generic filler. A reader should be able to tell exactly which meeting this was about.
- Write natural prose, not a hollow scaffold or a formatted report. It must read like a person who was in the room wrote it, in a plain-text email.
- Match the salutation and sign-off to the audience above — do NOT default to "Hi team," unless this is an internal-team message.
- NEVER emit placeholder syntax — neither bracketed placeholders ([Name]) nor curly braces ({first name} / {interviewer name}). If a name is unknown, phrase around it naturally or use "Hi there," / "Dear Hiring Team,".
- Plain text only — do NOT use any markdown formatting: no **bold**, no _italics_, no # headings, no backticks, and no "-" or "*" bullet markers. Email clients render these characters literally as visible asterisks/hashes/dashes, not as formatting, so markdown syntax would show up as clutter in the sent message. This applies to every draft, including Slack-style updates.
- Never state what was NOT discussed, decided, or covered (e.g. "no hiring signal was discussed," "no decisions were made," "nothing was mentioned about X"). If a topic is absent from the notes, simply omit it — do not narrate the gap.
- Keep it tight and copy-paste ready.
- Do not mention transcripts, AI, summaries, or that this was auto-generated.
