// electron/llm/customContextClassifier.ts
//
// Backward-compatible custom-context categorisation (REPORT_TO_CHATGPT Phase 3).
//
// Custom context is stored today as a SINGLE trusted blob (Mode.customContext).
// The spec wants it split into three categories so the
// prompt can decide what to include per answer type:
//
//   - pinned     : short, broadly-useful user instructions ("speak concisely",
//                  "I'm a senior backend engineer"). Always safe to surface in a
//                  compressed form.
//   - searchable : facts/notes/docs that should only appear when relevant to the
//                  current question (longer, topical chunks).
//   - sensitive  : salary, confidential pricing, private metrics, hidden
//                  strategy. Only surfaced when the answerType genuinely needs it
//                  (negotiation/sales) — never leaked into a coding/identity turn.
//
// This module does NOT change storage. It is a PURE, read-time classifier over
// the existing blob, so old users keep working with zero migration. It splits on
// blank-line / bullet boundaries, tags each chunk by content heuristics, and
// exposes a selector that picks the categories an AnswerType is allowed to see.
// No I/O, no LLM, no embeddings — cheap enough for the live path and unit-testable.
