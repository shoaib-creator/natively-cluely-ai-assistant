// electron/llm/repairAcceptance.ts
//
// ONE shared acceptance policy for a regenerated ("repaired") answer, used by
// BOTH answer paths:
//   - the live WTA path   (IntelligenceEngine.runWhatShouldISay)
//   - the manual-chat path (ipcHandlers gemini-chat-stream)
//
// Why this exists (PR #427 §1.4 — "Manual path / WTA path post-processing
// duplicated"): both paths independently decide whether to keep a regeneration,
// and the two copies had already DRIFTED. The WTA path rejected a repair that
// re-leaked an internal artifact and one that was a drastic length downgrade;
// the manual path had NEITHER guard — despite the WTA comment claiming the
// length floor "mirrors the same guard added to ipcHandlers.ts's manual-chat
// regen path". It was never added there, so a manual-chat profile repair that
// came back as a leaked <rewrite_instructions> block was accepted and shipped.
//
// Keeping the policy in one place is what stops that drift recurring. Callers
// still own their own DOMAIN validity re-check (profile evidence, doc-grounded
// validation) and pass the verdict in via `stillInvalid` — this module owns only
// the checks that are identical on both paths.
//
// Fix 2026-08-07: the length floor used to reject a repair BEFORE `stillInvalid`
// was checked, so a repair that a caller's domain re-check confirmed FIXED the
// original violation could still be discarded for being shorter — re-shipping
// the confirmed-bad original. The length floor now only fires when the caller
// did NOT pass `stillInvalid` (left it `undefined`) — i.e. it is a fallback net
// for a caller with no domain check of its own, not a second opinion that can
// overrule one. All three current call sites always pass an explicit boolean,
// so today this makes the length floor effectively dead for them; it stays as
// the fallback for any future caller that skips its own domain re-check.
