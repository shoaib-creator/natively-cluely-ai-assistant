// electron/llm/semanticAdmissionGate.ts
//
// Phase 1 of the semantic-retrieval repair (2026-08-13).
//
// HybridSearchEngine's legacy admission predicate is `blendedScore > 0.55`,
// where blendedScore = 0.6·cosine + up to 1.35 of metadata boosts. Verified
// consequences (ScoreNodeAdmissionArithmetic2026_08_13.test.mjs, real code):
//   - cosine 0.90 with no boosts scores 0.540 → REJECTED (semantics can't admit)
//   - cosine 0.60 with only the two QUERY-INDEPENDENT boosts (tenure+recency)
//     scores 0.560 → ADMITTED (contamination floor)
//
// The fix separates ADMISSION from RANKING:
//   admit iff cosine ≥ SEMANTIC_FLOOR[embeddingSpaceKey]
//   rank  by the existing blended score — boosts order candidates, they can
//         no longer admit them.
//
// Floors are keyed by the composite embedding-space key
// (`${provider}:${model}:${dims}`, electron/rag/embeddingSpace.ts) because
// score distributions differ materially between spaces — a single constant
// cannot serve gemini-768 and MiniLM-384 (the audit's §10 finding; the repo's
// own MIN_LEXICAL_SCORE derivation in ModeHybridRetriever.ts:135-160 is the
// pattern precedent). An UNKNOWN space resolves to null and the caller falls
// back to legacy admission — enforcing an uncalibrated floor is worse than
// not enforcing one.
//
// Flag: `semanticAdmissionGate`, DEFAULT ON since 2026-08-14 (kill-switch
// model — the calibrated-floor flip; see isSemanticAdmissionGateEnabled's doc
// for the full contract):
//   - env  NATIVELY_SEMANTIC_ADMISSION_GATE = 'off' | 'false' | '0' | 'disabled' → disabled
//   - settings  semanticAdmissionGate === false                                  → disabled
// Uncached by design (per-call string compare; caching is what makes env-flag
// tests race — see the profileGroundingV2 P2 notes).

 *   on real gemini vectors (every candidate cleared it).
 * local-384 (Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2): deliberately ABSENT — measured
 *   overlap 0.13 (relevant p10 = 0.089 BELOW irrelevant p90 = 0.170); any
 *   floor costs either ~45% false-admits or ~17% false-rejects, and a false
 *   reject manufactures an "I don't have that" answer. Keyless installs
 *   therefore keep legacy admission (resolveSemanticFloor → null) until a
 *   stronger local embedder ships. Re-run the calibration script before
