// SHARED question-shape patterns (WTA audit, 2026-08-18). These regexes were
// duplicated between transcriptQuestionExtractor.ts (the live selector) and
// questionLedger.ts (the shadow state model), and the audit repeatedly
// flagged copy drift as a hazard — the extractor/ledger MUST agree on what
// counts as small talk, a pause request, or an unpunctuated interrogative,
// or shadow parity numbers measure regex skew instead of architecture.
// Single source of truth; both consumers import from here. The Phase-3 E/I
// segmenter eventually replaces the lot.

// ── Core ask shapes + confidence (unified by code review 2026-08-19) ────────
// These three regexes and the score table below were duplicated between the
// live extractor and the shadow ledger, and had already drifted: the ledger
// scored a bare '?' 0.85 vs the extractor's 0.8, treated UNKNOWN punctuation
// provenance as 'unavailable' (0.95 vs 0.8), and its lead alternation was
// missing the tell-me/walk-me/describe family the extractor folds in. Because
// askShape confidence feeds rankActiveAsks, and the ledger_parity /
// ledger_divergence telemetry is the stated evidence for promoting the ledger,
// that skew meant the promotion metric was partly measuring copy drift instead
// of the architectures it is supposed to compare. One definition, one table.
