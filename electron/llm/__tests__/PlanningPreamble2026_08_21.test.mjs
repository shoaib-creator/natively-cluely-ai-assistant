// RC-6 regression from live shadow session C (2026-08-21): answers opened with
// the model's own deliberation ("Since the interviewer is asking directly
// about what I built… I should answer in my own voice…") before the real
// spoken answer. Presses 5/13/20/47 verbatim. Press 5 additionally leaked
// résumé figures INSIDE the meta-commentary. All four existing guards were
// measured no-ops on the verbatim text.
