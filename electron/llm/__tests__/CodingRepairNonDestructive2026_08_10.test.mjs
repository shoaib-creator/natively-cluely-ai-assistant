//
// USER-REPORTED, reproduced against the LIVE natively-api backend: a correct,
// complete coding answer is replaced by one that is strictly WORSE.
//
// This is NOT the deadline case (DeadlineTruncatedCodingNoScaffold2026_08_10).
// It happens on a perfectly healthy ~1.7s answer with no timeout at all: the
// model simply wrote good prose in its OWN format instead of the six-heading
// coding contract, so validateAnswerStructure "repaired" it — and the repair is
// LOSSY. Measured on live output (2 of 3 live coding answers hit it):
//
//   * the second fenced code block was DROPPED — the "**Python implementation:**"
//     heading was left followed by nothing;
//   * the model's own correct "runs in O(n) time and O(1) space" was replaced by
//     the "O(?)" placeholder, because extractComplexityText only inspects the
//     PREAMBLE and this answer stated its bound after a heading;
//   * a generic "Trace a small sample input..." dry-run the model never wrote
//     was inserted.
//
// repairCodingMarkdown documents itself as "NON-DESTRUCTIVE". These tests hold
// it to that: a repair may reorder and add headings, but it must never delete
// content the model actually produced, and must never overwrite a real,
// model-stated complexity with a placeholder.

// Verbatim shape of the live answer that regressed (trimmed for readability;
// the structural features that matter — inline complexity prose, two fenced
// blocks, bold pseudo-headings instead of `##` — are preserved exactly).
const LIVE_ANSWER = `Here's the approach:

**Approach: Iterative reversal using three pointers**

1. Use three pointers: \`prev\`, \`current\`, and \`next\`.
2. Initialize \`prev\` to \`None\` and \`current\` to the head of the list.
3. Continue until \`current\` becomes \`None\`. At that point, \`prev\` is the new head.

This runs in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space, since we only rearrange pointers without extra memory.

---

**Python implementation:**

\`\`\`python
def reverse_linked_list(head):
    prev = None
    current = head
    while current is not None:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    return prev
\`\`\`

**Usage (assuming a simple Node class):**

\`\`\`python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
\`\`\`

The function mutates the original list in place and returns the new head.`;
