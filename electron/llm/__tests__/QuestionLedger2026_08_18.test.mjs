// WTA audit Phase 2 (.audit/wta-audit.md §F/G): the question ledger — a
// session-scoped record of every detected ask, its relationships, and its
// answered state. Replaces "the 180s transcript window IS the question state"
// as the conceptual model: the transcript provides evidence; the ledger holds
// state. Phase 2 ships the ledger + deterministic ask detection and runs it
// SHADOW-ONLY (observe-only trace behind a default-off flag); selection
// still belongs to extractLatestQuestion until shadow metrics justify
// promotion (Phase 5).
//
// The scenarios below are the spec's own acceptance cases, including the
// final success criterion (notification-system → 3-part compound → "And
// specifically the rebalancing problem?" resolving as a refinement of the
// consumer-groups ask).
