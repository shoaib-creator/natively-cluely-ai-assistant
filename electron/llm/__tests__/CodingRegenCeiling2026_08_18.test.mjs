// F-305 regression test (audit/autopilot-2026-08-18).
//
// The coding regens (meta-reply retry and completeness retry) aborted at a
// hardcoded 4000 chars, while liveDeadlines' own sizing note measures the very
// artifact their prompt asks for — "a six-section coding answer with multiple
// code blocks" — at ~8000. A correct answer was therefore cut mid-sentence,
// and the meta-retry accepted on nothing more than "length >= 20 plus some
// closed code fence", so that truncation was accepted and atomically REPLACED
// the streamed row: the user's final answer ended mid-word.
//
// Honest scope: checkCodeCompleteness validates the FENCED CODE, not trailing
// prose, so it catches a truncated code block but not a cut-off "## Complexity"
// paragraph. The abort-ceiling raise is what prevents that case; the acceptance
// change closes the truncated-code case and matches the sibling regen.
