//
// RC-2 regression from live shadow session C (2026-08-21): the user's
// "Real-time prompt" (Mode.customContext = "ALL the technical code should be
// in Cpp , regardless of interviewers choice") reached ZERO of the coding
// answers — pinnedModeInstructionsChars was 0 on 150/152 assemblies, and every
// coding press emitted Python. Three independent blocks; this file covers the
// classifier one:
//
//   customContextClassifier's CUSTOM_CONTEXT_FORBIDDEN_TYPES dropped ALL
//   custom context for coding/DSA/system-design/debugging/identity — including
//   pure OUTPUT-FORMAT DIRECTIVES, which are exactly the chunks that only
//   matter on those turns. The gate exists to keep FACTS (resume notes, company
//   context, salary) out of self-contained algorithm answers; a formatting
//   directive is not a fact and cannot contaminate one.
//
// Fix under test: format directives survive the forbidden-type gate; factual
// notes and sensitive chunks are still dropped there. Paired live API calls
// (DeepSeek, 3/3 vs 3/3) proved the model obeys the directive whenever it is
// delivered — this classifier gate was the delivery failure.
