//
// RC-1a regression from live shadow session C (2026-08-21): 17 of 85 presses
// routed to ethical_usage_answer (a safe-decline contract) because
// isStealthEvasionQuestion's branch (b) — soft visibility verb + interview
// object — tested each regex against the WHOLE string with no proximity
// requirement. In the session-cumulative question blob, "the call" came from
// the interviewer's opener ("I was looking at your resume before the call")
// and "noticeably" from a performance question ~700 chars later ("the
// application starts becoming noticeably slower"): two unrelated sentences
// pairing into a stealth verdict no single sentence supports.
//
// Fix under test: branch (b) is sentence-scoped — the soft-visibility verb and
// the interview object must co-occur in ONE sentence. Branch (a) (explicit
// evasion intent) deliberately stays whole-string: over-coverage there is the
// documented safety posture (code-review 2026-06-06b).
