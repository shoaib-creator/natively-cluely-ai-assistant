// The user's ORIGINAL report — "it shows a new answer that's wrong after
// initially showing the right answer" — reproduced from a live capture and
// traced to the CLIENT, not the natively-api provider cascade.
//
// what_to_answer, Natively fast-mode, 2026-08-12:
//
//   [NativelyAPI] stream server error  stage=during_stream tfft=2084ms
//                                      tokens=8047 chars=22871
//                                      error=ai_unavailable (aborted at 61s)
//   [LLMHelper] Natively fast-mode failed, falling back
//   [NativelyAPI] stream completed     chars=2342          <- a WHOLE new answer
//   [SessionTracker] addAssistantMessage length=25210
//
//   22871 + 2342 = 25213, stored 25210 — a 3-char trim delta. The fallback's
//   answer was APPENDED to the partial, not substituted for it. The user read a
//   truncated answer immediately followed by a second, different, complete one.
//
// Cause: `yield*` cannot be undone. Every catch-and-continue site in the text
// path delegated with `yield*` and, on ANY error, fell through to the next
// provider — including errors raised long after tokens had been forwarded to
// the renderer.
//
// The codebase already had the correct rule written down for the VISION path
// (above streamVisionWithFallback):
//
//   "A failure AFTER commit cannot switch providers (that would duplicate
//    output) — we end the stream gracefully."
//
// ...and implemented it there via `committedProvider`. The text path had the
// rule documented at streamGeminiTextCascade but never applied at its own
// fall-through sites. `trackCommit` is how they now observe it.
//
// These tests drive the REAL LLMHelper.prototype.trackCommit — not a local
// re-implementation of `yield* / catch / fall through`, which would only prove
// JavaScript semantics rather than that this file behaves correctly.
