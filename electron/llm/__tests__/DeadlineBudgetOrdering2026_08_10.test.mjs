// electron/llm/__tests__/DeadlineBudgetOrdering2026_08_10.test.mjs
//
// The Electron client and natively-api each enforce their own first-token
// deadline, and they were INVERTED:
//
//   client  LIVE_TOTAL_HARD_TIMEOUT_MS   8_000ms
//   server  AI_TTFT_BUDGET_MS           10_000ms   (natively-api/server.js)
//
// A Natively-key user's chat goes to `${NATIVELY_API_URL}/v1/chat`
// (LLMHelper.ts:3462), where the server runs a sequential provider cascade —
// Gemini Flash -> MiniMax-M3 -> Gemini Pro — cutting over at AI_TTFT_BUDGET_MS
// when a provider is slow to first token. That cutover is the mechanism that is
// SUPPOSED to rescue a slow turn.
//
// With the client ceiling BELOW the server cutover, the client always gave up
// first: it abandoned the turn at 8s, 2s before the server would have rotated to
// a healthy provider. The user got the local fallback (or, for coding, the
// fabricated scaffold — see DeadlineTruncatedCodingNoScaffold2026_08_10) instead
// of the answer the server was about to produce.
//
// Correct ordering: the layer that can actually RECOVER (the server, which has
// another provider to try) must be allowed to act before the layer that can only
// GIVE UP (the client). This test pins that invariant so the two budgets cannot
// silently drift back out of order.
