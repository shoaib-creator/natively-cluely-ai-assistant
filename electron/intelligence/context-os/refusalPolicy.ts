// WHEN IS A REFUSAL HONEST?
//
// Live report 2026-08-11: WTA with a screenshot in a looking-for-work mode
// (sourceAuthority=profile_only, zero reference files, empty question) answered
// "This is not directly mentioned in the uploaded material." — three times.
// The kernel's own trace said finalAction="answer"; the evidence layer overrode
// it. With zero candidates every pack decision site returns
// `refuse_insufficient_evidence`, the coordinator govern sites set
// `govern: true` unconditionally, and the surface yields the canned string
// without ever calling the model. The same screenshot through manual-chat
// answered normally.
//
// The line (independent review, 2026-08-11): a refusal is truthful only when
// the mode's authority promises a BOUNDED UNIVERSE — "answer only from X" as
// the product contract. Those are exactly the authorities modeSourceContract
// marks `evidenceRequired: true`. Everywhere else, an empty pack means the
// mode simply has nothing to add — the turn must FALL BACK to the model, not
// refuse on behalf of a universe that was never bounded (and, in the reported
// case, never populated).
//
// This module is deliberately tiny and pure so the line is testable on its
// own. It hand-mirrors EVIDENCE_REQUIRED_FOR_AUTHORITY rather than importing
// modeSourceContract (services → context-os would invert the layering);
// ContextOsRefusalGoverns2026_08_11.test.mjs is the drift guard that asserts
// the mirror agrees with the real mapping for every shipped authority.

 * Second live report, 2026-08-11 (same day as the refuse-path fix): a WTA
 * screenshot turn in a blank GENERAL-template mode was short-circuited into
 * "This mode only answers from your uploaded material… switch to a mode that
 * enables that source". The general template's SEEDED contract claims
 * reference_files_primary; the mode had ZERO files; the kernel demoted the
 * owner to 'clarify'; and the short-circuit ran before the provider call. The
 * same contract FORBADE every profile source — so the message pointed at a
 * résumé it would not have used, about material never uploaded, for a question
 * never typed.
 *
 * The same honest line as packGovernsGeneration: a clarification between
 * source universes is only worth interrupting the user for when the mode's own
 * bounded universe actually EXISTS. A reference-bound authority with no files
 * has nothing to disambiguate into — the honest move is answering.
 *
 * Deliberately scoped to the reference-bound trio: ask_if_ambiguous /
 * general_mixed clarifications disambiguate between REAL universes and must
 * survive, and transcript_only never has files, so a bare files check would
 * gag it. Unknown authorities fail toward answering the user.

/**
 * WHEN DOES A TEXT-EVIDENCE DECLINE YIELD TO CURRENT-SCREEN EVIDENCE?
 *
 * Audit 2026-08-19 (user directive: "no context of screenshot is dropped if
 * the contexts disagree"): a screenshot, browser DOM capture, or screen OCR is
 * the user DELIBERATELY handing the turn its current-screen evidence. Every
 * canned decline in the govern path — the WTA
 * refuse/clarify short-circuits, LLMHelper's final-prompt-boundary refusal,
 * and the post-stream doc-grounded answer swap — is a verdict about the TEXT
 * evidence universe only ("your files/transcript don't contain this"). With a
 * current screen attached that verdict is answering the wrong question: the
 * user's evidence for THIS turn includes either pixels or captured screen text.
 * Refusing there silently drops the current screen.
 *
 * Manual chat already draws this line (its clarify short-circuit is gated
 * `!imagePaths?.length`, ipcHandlers). This predicate is the shared, testable
 * form of that rule for every other decline site. It does NOT weaken source
 * isolation: the text-evidence pack still governs what TEXT sources render
 * (forbidden sources stay forbidden; the profile stays suppressed on governed
 * turns) — only the decision to answer-vs-decline yields to current-screen
 * evidence. The historical function name is retained for API compatibility.

 * The FINAL-PROMPT-BOUNDARY twin of declineYieldsToAttachedImages, keyed on the

 *

 * them is the decline class this rule was scoped to:
 *
 *   answer_policy_ask_clarification          ← decline: yields to current screen
 *   answer_policy_refuse_insufficient_evidence ← decline: yields to current screen
 *   rendered_manifest_invalid                ← structural: prompt is untrustworthy
 *   serialized_evidence_marker_missing       ← structural: prompt is untrustworthy
 *   missing_required_evidence_family:…       ← contract breach: required grounding absent
 *   forbidden_evidence_rendered:…            ← SOURCE-ISOLATION LEAK
 *
 * A blanket `!ok && imagePaths?.length` bypass dispatches ALL of them, so a
 * forbidden evidence family that reached the assembled prompt would be sent
 * verbatim to every cloud provider with no downstream re-validation — the exact
 * outcome declineYieldsToAttachedImages's own contract above promises against
 * ("forbidden sources stay forbidden"). The decline reasons are the only ones
 * the upstream visual-context exemption creates: a refuse/clarify pack that was
 * let through at the govern block still carries its policy into this validator,
 * so without this narrow yield those turns would be re-refused at the boundary.
 *
 * Fails CLOSED for every other reason, with or without current-screen evidence.
