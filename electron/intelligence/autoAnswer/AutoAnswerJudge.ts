 * phrased a way no pattern anticipates. The user chose to override spec V2

 * each committed candidate — "is this a complete ask, directed at the user,
 * worth answering right now?" — and the heuristic detector becomes the
 * prefilter (obvious non-asks never cost a call) and the fallback (judge
 * absent, over deadline, or unparseable → exact pre-judge behavior).
 *
 * This module is PURE: prompt building, verdict parsing/validation, and the

Rules learned from live meetings:
- A task stated declaratively IS an ask ("your task is to recreate this game in React", "we need help designing the checkout flow") — questions do not require a "?".
- Rule explanations, demos, storytelling and thinking aloud are NOT asks even when they contain question words ("you have to guess what the word is", "which letters are in the word").
- A question the SAME voice immediately answers itself ("Why do we shard by user id? Because hot keys.") is closed — not an ask.
- The OTHERS channel merges several voices, so one candidate often contains a lead-in, a question, AND another participant's reply — e.g. "Yes, I'm ready. Okay, have you heard of the popular word game called wordle? Yeah, yeah, I've played it a few times." That is still an ASK: the reply came from another participant, NOT from the USER, who has not answered and still needs one. Put the question itself in question_text. A merged reply NEVER closes a question and NEVER lowers answerability — score the ask exactly as if it stood alone. Only these two are closed: (a) the speaker answering their OWN rhetorical question ("Why do we shard by user id? Because hot keys."), and (b) a comprehension check about what the speaker just explained that already got its yes/no ("Is that correct? Correct.", "…, right?" after a recap).
- Logistics/confirmation ("can you see my screen?", "are you ready?") are asks but rarely worth an AI-drafted answer: answerability low.
- Speech that REMOVES work is not an ask, however imperative it sounds. Granting and scoping — "you can totally look up syntax", "authentication and user profiles you can skip", "feel free to use any language", "take your time" — hands the user permission, not a question. Logistics — "go ahead and share your screen", "can you make the font bigger", "we have about 20 minutes left" — arranges the session, screens, tools or timing. But a directive to PRODUCE something is a real ask, not logistics: "let's see how you code this out", "go ahead and write the function", "walk me through your implementation" all require work from the user and must fire — PROVIDED the transcript already says what to produce. "Let's transition into the coding portion, go ahead and share your screen" before any problem has been stated is still logistics: there is nothing to write yet. Deferral — "we'll talk about that later", "let's come back to that", "we'll get to how we scale it in a bit" — postpones, and naming the subject it will come back to does NOT make it an ask now. None of these are asks: is_ask false.
- An interviewer PARAPHRASE of what the user just said ("okay, it sounds more like you want a low-latency platform", "so you're saying we can shard by user id") is a comprehension check, not a new ask — unless a genuine question follows it, in which case that question is the ask.
- A mid-sentence fragment that clearly continues ("The way that you guess it is you") is incomplete.
- A speaker who ANNOUNCES a structure and has not delivered it is incomplete: "design a class that supports these three operations" followed by only the first operation is unfinished — wait for all three. Same for "a few things", "two parts", "first… second…". Answering half a spec is worse than waiting.
- The meeting audio may also carry the USER'S OWN voice. A question that came FROM the user must NOT be answered, and two tells give it away: (a) it asks the other party to permit or specify something about the task the USER was given — "Can I code in Python?", "Are these values integers or strings?", "Is it just one value?" — especially when a reply in the same turn grants or specifies it ("sure", "yeah, you can assume that they're integers"); (b) it is the user reasoning aloud while working — "what variables do we need here?", "how do I get a random value with equal probability?". Contrast with a question ABOUT the user that someone else answers: "have you heard of wordle?" followed by "yeah, I've played it a few times" is the interviewer asking, and it stands as an ask.
- Judge completeness on the candidate's OWN last words, never on what the surrounding context lets you guess. It is incomplete when it ends on a conjunction or preposition ("…and", "…so I'm going to", "…that you"), or announces something without stating it ("and your task— Connor—", "your task is", "what I want you to do is"), or trails off on a dash or ellipsis. Never return a question_text that is itself such a fragment — wait for the rest.
- Questions directed at an audience or third party ("let me explain to the viewers…") are not directed at the USER.
- A summary of what the speaker just explained that ends in a tag like ", right?" or ", okay?" is a comprehension check — rhetorical, not an ask.
- Statements about work, plans or logistics that expect at most acknowledgement ("your task list is getting long, we should prioritize it") are NOT asks — an ask requires something to answer or produce.
- First-person narration of what the SPEAKER is doing or handing over — "I'm going to give you a link right now", "all that I'm going to be giving you is an API endpoint", "it's hosted on X and the endpoint is very simple: you hit it and you get…" — is a STATEMENT, never an ask, even when it describes the materials for a task that was already given.

answerability = how much the USER wants a drafted answer RIGHT NOW:
- 0.9-1.0 — a question or task the USER is expected to answer or start next, INCLUDING short or yes/no ones ("have you heard of wordle?", "are you familiar with CoderPad?"). Directness matters, not length.
- 0.6-0.8 — a real ask that is mostly social or procedural.
- 0.3-0.5 — audio/screen/logistics checks ("can you see my screen?").
- 0.0-0.2 — anything not an ask, and any restatement of an ask already answered.

action — what the assistant should DO, and the field that actually decides:
- "answer" — draft the answer now. This is the default for every real ask the USER must handle next, and it explicitly INCLUDES questions about the user's own experience, background, projects and opinions ("have you heard of wordle?", "tell me about a time you disagreed", "why did you pick Postgres?"), and small logistics they still have to respond to ("can you see my screen?", "are you ready?"). That the user could answer in their own words is not a reason to withhold.
- "silent" — not an ask at all, not directed at the USER, unfinished, or already answered.

WHEN IN DOUBT, ANSWER. There are only these two outcomes: a drafted answer the user can ignore in a glance costs them nothing, while a missed one costs them the moment. Reserve "silent" for the cases the rules above make clear.

Reply with ONLY this JSON object, no prose, no code fences:
{"is_ask": boolean, "directed_at_user": boolean, "complete": boolean, "act": "question"|"follow_up"|"coding_task"|"behavioral"|"technical"|"rhetorical"|"statement"|"social"|"incomplete", "action": "answer"|"offer"|"silent", "answerability": number 0..1, "question_text": string|null}
question_text: the ask itself, quoted VERBATIM from the candidate — the WHOLE ask, so a task stated in several parts keeps all of them, not just the last part. Use null when the entire candidate is the ask, or when there is no ask.
