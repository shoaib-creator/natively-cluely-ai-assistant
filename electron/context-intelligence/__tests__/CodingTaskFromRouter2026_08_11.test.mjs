//
// Direct-evidence follow-up to the V3 coding-contract fix. Dumping the system
// prompt that actually reaches the provider showed the contract present on one
// coding turn and ABSENT on another:
//
//   [lru] prompt=17157ch contract=true   <- "Implement an LRU cache ..."
//   [bfs] prompt=14430ch contract=false  <- "Write a BFS shortest-path function ..."
//
// Both route to a coding answerType via AnswerPlanner (coding_question_answer
// and dsa_question_answer respectively). The divergence is that the bridge does
// not ask the router — it re-derives the flag from V3's own keyword regex:
//
//   codingTask: result.decision.questionTypes.includes('CODING_TASK')
//
// and CODING_TASK_RE (turn-classifier.ts:343) is a hand-maintained keyword list:
//   reverse a | implement (a|an) | write (a|the) (code|function|program|query)
//   | solve | algorithm for | time complexity | leetcode | binary search
//   | linked list | sort(ing)? algorithm | dynamic programming
//
// "Write a BFS shortest-path function" matches none of them — "write a function"
// is split by the word "BFS shortest-path". Neither does "Given a binary tree,
// return its level order traversal". Both are ordinary interview questions.
//
// This matters because that flag gates the six-section coding contract. A miss
// means the model is never told to produce Complexity or a Dry Run, and the
// downstream repair then paints "O(?) — state the actual time bound" into
// sections the model was never asked for — the exact live symptom.
//
// The bridge's own comment says detection "stays with the existing
// deterministic router (AnswerPlanner), never re-derived here from text".
// These tests pin that: the caller's routed answerType decides, and the regex
// is only a fallback for callers that supply none.
