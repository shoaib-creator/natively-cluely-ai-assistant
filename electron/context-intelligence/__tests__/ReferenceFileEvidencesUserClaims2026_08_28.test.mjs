// T1 — a user's own reference file may evidence claims about their own work.
//
// THE MASTER CAUSE (docs/retrieval-handoff/01-ROOT-CAUSES.md RC1).
// `PERSONAL_RE` turns any second-person question into a USER_* claim, and
// REFERENCE_FILE was authoritative for NO USER_* claim. In an interview every
// question is second person, so an uploaded file describing the user's own
// projects was unreachable for every one of them, in all nine modes. Proved with
// perfect retrieval: a chunk literally containing the answer, at score 0.99,
// discarded by 9/9 modes with evidence=0 and answerability=NONE. No amount of
// better chunking, embedding or ranking can rescue a turn that never receives
// evidence.
//
// Measured before: 0 of 6 realistic interviewer phrasings reached the file in
// any mode. After: 6 of 6 in all nine. The three neutral document-shaped
// controls reached it before and still do.
//
// ── WHAT THIS SUITE IS REALLY GUARDING ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// Widening source authority is the single riskiest change in this subsystem —
// four documented incidents came from getting these lists wrong in EITHER
// direction. So most of what follows asserts what did NOT change:
//
//   • every `prohibited` list is byte-identical. The JD-as-experience
//     protection (a job description states what the EMPLOYER wants and can
//     never evidence what the USER has) lives there.
//   • USER_MOTIVATION is untouched. A document about what someone BUILT cannot
//     evidence why they want a job.
//   • with NO documents attached, reachability is byte-identical to before —
//     which is what keeps the "what are my strengths?" anti-fabrication guards
//     firing in a profile-less mode.
//   • no mode gains a source its own policy does not authorize.
