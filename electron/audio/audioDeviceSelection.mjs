 * the launcher's saved-preference read (App.tsx).
 *
 * Authored as .mjs + .d.mts (same pattern as systemAudioHealthClassifier.mjs)
 * so the node:test suite imports the REAL implementation instead of asserting
 * on main.ts source text.
 *
 * CROSS-PLATFORM: no platform branches, and none are wanted.
 *   - The internal-device filter is a name match. macOS is the only platform
 *     that produces the name today; on Windows/WASAPI nothing matches and the
 *     filter is inert, so both platforms run identical code.
 *   - resolveRequestedInputDevice mirrors the tier order of
 *     `resolve_input_device` in native-module/src/microphone.rs, which is
 *     itself shared by the CoreAudio and WASAPI backends (not #[cfg]-gated).
 *     Keep the two in sync: this function decides whether we even ASK Rust to
 *     open a device, so a divergence turns a clean fallback back into the
 *     hard "Input device not found" error it exists to prevent.
