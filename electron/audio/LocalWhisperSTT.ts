/**
 * LocalWhisperSTT — local Whisper / Distil-Whisper / Moonshine STT provider.
 *
 * Dual-channel architecture: Natively captures Mic and System Audio as two
 * completely separate native streams. createSTTProvider() instantiates this
 * class TWICE — once per channel. No diarization model is needed; speaker
 * attribution is free from the hardware.
 *
 * STREAMING DESIGN (closes the latency gap with cloud STT):
 *
 *   Cloud STT providers (Deepgram/Soniox/ElevenLabs) emit *interim*
 *   transcripts every 100–300ms while the user is still speaking. Whisper
 *   wasn't designed for streaming — we approximate it with a per-model
 *   profile (see resolveStreamingProfile):
 *
 *   Whisper / Distil-Whisper path (slow, batch-architected models):
 *     - Tick every 1500ms while a segment is open (after 800ms of audio)
 *     - Apply LocalAgreement-2: only commit text where two overlapping
 *       inferences agree (longest common prefix). Stabilizes flicker.
 *     - First interim emit ~1.5–2.5s after speech starts.
 *
 *   Moonshine path (streaming-native, deterministic, ~100ms inference):
 *     - Tick every 750ms after just 400ms of audio
 *     - Skip LA-2 — the model's output is already stable; emit each
 *       cleaned partial directly.
 *     - First interim emit ~400–600ms after speech starts.
 *
 *   Nemotron 3.5 ASR Streaming path (genuinely chunked, cache-aware RNNT):
 *     - Tick every 560ms after 560ms of audio — NOT a tunable polling rate
 *       like the profiles above; 560ms (8960 samples @ 16kHz) is the fixed
 *       chunk size the ONNX export itself was built around.
 *     - Skip LA-2 — same rationale as Moonshine: the worker's per-chunk
 *       greedy RNNT decode is already stable.
 *     - First interim emit ~560ms after speech starts.
 *
 *   When VAD closes the segment (or hits MAX_SEGMENT_MS for a soft commit):
 *     - Run a final pass on the full segment
 *     - Emit { isFinal: true, confidence: 0.9 }
 *     - Reset session state for the next segment
