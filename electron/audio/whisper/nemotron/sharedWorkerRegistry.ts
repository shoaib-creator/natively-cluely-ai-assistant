/**
 * Main-process registry that lets TWO LocalWhisperSTT instances (mic +
 * system-audio — the default configuration when localWhisperPerChannelEnabled
 * is off) share ONE Nemotron worker (one loaded model, one set of 3 ONNX
 * sessions) instead of each spawning its own. See
 * .superpowers/sdd/2026-08-10-nemotron-local-stt/dual-channel-fix-brief.md
 * for the full design rationale.
 *
 * Worker-side (whisperWorker.ts) already keeps fully isolated per-channel
 * NemotronEngine instances keyed by channelId — this module's whole job is
 * refcounted LIFECYCLE: deciding when to cold-start a worker, when a second
 * caller can just join the existing one, and when the worker actually dies
 * (only once every channel has released it).
 *
 * State lives on globalThis, NOT at module scope — matching
 * electron/utils/onnxThreadConfig.ts's own established precedent (that
 * file's own comment explains why: this module is inlined into multiple
 * esbuild dist bundles, and a per-bundle copy of this state would let two
 * different bundles each believe they own the one-and-only shared worker).

// wrongly block for up to 15s then throw, or (worse) succeed and load a
// second, fully redundant set of 3 ONNX sessions — exactly what this whole

// still inside this critical section (hasn't reached `releaseTurn()` yet —
// e.g. a crash racing a concurrent join). Resetting the lock there would let
// the next caller chain off a fresh resolved promise and enter the critical
// section concurrently with the in-flight one, reintroducing the exact
