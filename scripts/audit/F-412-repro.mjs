// F-412 repro: the false-refusal repair bypassed its own off-topic gate.
//
// The gate (wholeNameHit || tokenHits.size >= 2) exists so an honest
// "not in the document" refusal STANDS for an off-topic question — its own
// comment says "Off-topic questions match neither a whole name nor >=2
// distinct tokens, so their honest refusal stands."
//
// But isTier1Or2Evidence was OR'd in as an independent third disjunct, and
// EvidenceAssembler.computeTier is TOPIC-BLIND: it returns tier 2 for any
// synthesis-classified question the moment the pack yields >=1 card, and
// OkfRetriever's type/confidence boosts clear the score floor with ZERO
// query-word overlap. So the gate could never veto, and an off-topic
// synthesis question discarded a correct refusal and re-prompted the model
// with a stronger-synthesis instruction — the exact hallucination pressure
// the gate was built to prevent.
//
// Models the decision exactly as the handler computes it, and cross-checks the
// real source so the harness cannot drift from the shipped expression.
